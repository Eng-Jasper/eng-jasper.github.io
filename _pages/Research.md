ðŸ”Œ **Thyristor Turn-Off Modeling for HVDC Systems**

In high-voltage direct current (HVDC) systems, thyristors are key components that control the flow of electricity. However, simulating how they behaveâ€”especially how they turn offâ€”can be very complex, and there is currently no widely accepted model for this process.

To address this gap, I developed a detailed and high-fidelity model using Simulink, a simulation tool commonly used in engineering. This model helps engineers and researchers better understand the turn-off behavior of thyristor valves, which is essential for designing safer and more reliable HVDC systems.

**This project aims to:**

- Improve how HVDC thyristor turn-off dynamics are studied.

- Provide a practical tool for researchers and system designers.

- Lay the groundwork for future development in this area.

The model is currently being refined for academic publication and is under consideration for patenting, due to its potential to fill a critical gap in power electronics simulation.
