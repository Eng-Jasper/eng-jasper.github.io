About me
Hi! I’m Jasper, an electrical engineer and researcher specializing in control systems for electric power networks. My work focuses on developing intelligent, resilient, and sustainable energy solutions through the design and implementation of advanced control techniques and data-driven system modeling.

With academic training in electrical power systems and practical experience in field deployments, I bring a multidisciplinary perspective to the challenges of modern energy infrastructure. I’m particularly interested in the integration of real-time data, system dynamics, and automation to improve the operation of power grids in both developed and emerging contexts.

My Work and Research
My research and technical work sit at the intersection of control theory, electrical power systems, and intelligent infrastructure. I work on tools and models that support real-time monitoring, system control, and strategic planning in electrical networks.

Highlights of my work include:

- Thyristor Turn-Off Modeling: Developed a Simulink-based model to simulate the turn-off dynamics of HVDC thyristor valves—an area lacking standardized modeling tools. This project is being advanced for academic publication and patent consideration.

- Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) & Grid Monitoring: Contributed to the deployment and integration of PMUs into a national power grid. Designed algorithms for power quality visualization, conducted optimal PMU placement studies, and supported engineer training and project analysis.

My Background and History
My journey blends academic achievement, industry experience, and community leadership.

Academic Training:

- Master’s in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University (with strong focus on control systems, power electronics, energy systems and Data Science)

- Bachelor’s in Electrical Power Engineering at University of Rwanda

Field & Industry Experience:

- Worked in power system operations and maintenance with utilities and hospitals.

- Experience with solar mini-grids, substations, industrial automation, and protective relays.

- Provided engineering support in both urban and rural electrification contexts.

Leadership Roles:

President, Energy and Embedded Systems Club Led events and initiatives focused on renewable energy, embedded control, and smart grid technologies.
My Background and History
I actively engage with research and engineering communities that share a passion for solving critical energy challenges through innovation, collaboration, and open knowledge.

**Professional Memberships:**

- IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers)

- IEEE Power Electronics Society

- IEEE Industry Applications Society

- IEEE Young Professionals

- IEEE Power & Energy Society

These communities enable me to stay connected with emerging trends, contribute to peer exchange, and build collaborations that push the boundaries of what is possible in electrical engineering.
