Hello! I'm Jasper, an electrical engineer and researcher specializing in control systems, power electronics, and intelligent energy systems. I will begin pursuing a Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/) in Fall 2025. I will be joining the Intelligent Automation Laboratory (IALab) within the Centre for Intelligent Machines.

<!-- My research explores the convergence of control theory, renewable energy systems, and data-driven modeling, with a focus on developing resilient and intelligent solutions for modern electric power infrastructure. I am particularly interested in real-time system monitoring, dynamic control strategies, and sustainable energy integration for both developing and industrialized regions.-->

## Research & Technical Work
My technical and academic work focuses on enhancing the stability, efficiency, and intelligence of electric power systems. I design tools and methodologies that support real-time monitoring, automated control, and strategic decision-making in energy networks.

### Key Projects and Contributions

- Thyristor Turn-Off Modeling
  
Developed a high-fidelity Simulink model to simulate the turn-off behavior of HVDC thyristor valves, addressing the lack of standardized modeling techniques. This work is being refined for academic publication and potential patenting.

- Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) Deployment – Rwanda Power Grid

Collaborated with the national utility under Rwanda Energy Group to deploy and integrate PMU devices into the national grid. Contributions included optimal placement analysis, power quality visualization algorithms, engineer training, and system commissioning.

Further details on this work can be found [here](https://www.africa.engineering.cmu.edu/news/2025/06/09-powering-future.html).

- Energy Systems and Solar Electrification

Experience in the design, operation, and maintenance of solar mini-grids, substations, protective relay systems, and hospital energy infrastructure—bridging the gap between engineering design and real-world applications.

## Academic Background
- Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering (in progress)
McGill University

  <!-- - Focus: Control Systems, Power Electronics -->

- M.Sc. in Electrical and Computer Engineering
Carnegie Mellon University

  - Concentration: Power and Energy Systems, Control Systems, and Data Science

- B.Sc. in Electrical Power Engineering
University of Rwanda

## Professional Experience
Before beginning my doctoral studies, I worked extensively in power systems operations and energy infrastructure projects. My experience spans both technical engineering roles and applied research in utilities, industrial facilities, and rural electrification initiatives.

## Leadership & Community Engagement
- President, Energy and Embedded Systems Club

Led campus-wide events focused on renewable energy, embedded controls, and smart grid innovations.

- Mentorship & Technical Training

Delivered technical workshops and mentorship for junior engineers and students on topics such as PMU integration, control system design, and energy analytics.

## Professional Memberships
I am an active member of several IEEE societies, where I contribute to professional discourse, access emerging research, and collaborate with peers in academia and industry:

- [IEEE Power & Energy Society (PES)](https://ieee-pes.org/)

- [IEEE Power Electronics Society (PELS)](https://www.ieee-pels.org/)

- [IEEE Industry Applications Society (IAS)](https://ias.ieee.org/)

- [IEEE Young Professionals](https://yp.ieee.org/)


These communities enable me to stay connected with emerging trends, contribute to peer exchange, and build collaborations that push the boundaries of what is possible in electrical engineering.
