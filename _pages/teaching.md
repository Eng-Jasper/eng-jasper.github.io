**👨🏽‍🏫 Graduate Teaching Assistant – Carnegie Mellon University
Courses:**

- Power Electronics (Sept 2024 – Dec 2024)

- Power Electronics for Utility Systems (Jan 2024 – Present)

As a Graduate Teaching Assistant at Carnegie Mellon University Africa, I supported graduate-level courses focused on power electronics and its application in modern utility systems. My role involved helping students grasp both theoretical concepts and hands-on skills needed to model and design power electronic systems.

**Key Contributions:**

- Led MATLAB and Simulink training sessions to help students simulate and analyze power electronics circuits

- Provided one-on-one academic support, helping students understand challenging topics and complete lab assignments

- Collaborated with the course instructor to prepare course materials, assist during lectures, and guide lab sessions

- Helped evaluate student work by reviewing assignments and projects and giving constructive feedback

This experience enhanced my ability to explain complex engineering ideas in a clear, structured way. It also allowed me to contribute to a strong learning environment and mentor students with diverse backgrounds and learning styles.
