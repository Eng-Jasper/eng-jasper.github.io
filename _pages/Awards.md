## Jeremiah Mpagazehe Rising Researcher Award
Carnegie Mellon University Africa – Class of 2025

I was honored to receive the [Jeremiah N. Mpagazehe Rising Researcher Award](https://www.africa.engineering.cmu.edu/students/fellowships-awards.html), which recognizes a graduating student who has shown outstanding leadership and research excellence. This award celebrates the legacy of Dr. Jeremiah Mpagazehe, a respected CMU alumnus and scholar-in-residence at CMU-Africa.

My recognition was based on:

- Leading the Energy and Embedded Systems Club (Jan–Nov 2024)

- Serving as a Teaching Assistant for power electronics courses

- Initiating original research on thyristor turn-off modeling in Simulink

- Contributing to Project UMURIRO, where I developed algorithms for PMU analysis and trained engineers at Rwanda Energy Group
